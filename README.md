# library-Book-Management-System 
Welcome to the Library Book Management System! ðŸŽ‰

## Overview
I've created a simple Library Book Management System in C# using records, LINQ, and lists. This system lets you manage books and members, track borrowed books, and use LINQ queries to handle and display data efficiently.

## Features
- **Manage Books**
  - Add new books and remove them from the library.
  - Display all books and search by title, author, or genre using LINQ.
  
- **Manage Members**
  - Add and remove library members.
  - Display all members and search by name using LINQ.
  
- **Borrowing System**
  - Allow members to borrow and return books.
  - Track borrowed books and use LINQ to filter and view records.

## Components
- **Records**: I defined records for `Book`, `Member`, and `BorrowRecord` to structure our data.
- **Lists**: Lists are used to manage collections of books, members, and borrow records.
- **LINQ**: LINQ helps in querying and filtering data from our lists.

## How to Use
1. **Define Records**: Check out how I created records for `Book`, `Member`, and `BorrowRecord`.
2. **LibraryManager Class**: This class handles managing books and members and operations for borrowing and returning books.
3. **Main Program**: Run the main program to see the system in action and test its features.
